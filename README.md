# Ruby Holidays Gem [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/holidays/holidays.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/holidays/holidays)

A set of functions to deal with holidays in Ruby.

Extends Ruby's built-in Date class and supports custom holiday definition lists.

## Installation

To install the gem from RubyGems:

    gem install holidays

This gem is tested with the following ruby versions: 2.2.0, 2.3.0, 2.4.0, 2.5.0, JRuby

This gem follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). The guarantee specifically covers:

 * methods in the topmost `Holidays` namespace e.g. `Holidays.<method>`
 * the [core extension](#extending-rubys-date-and-time-classes)

Please note that we consider definition changes to be 'minor' bumps, meaning they are backwards compatible with your code but might give different holiday results!

## Time zones

Time zones are ignored.  This library assumes that all dates are within the same time zone.

### Using the Holidays class

Get all holidays on April 25, 2008 in Australia.

    date = Date.civil(2008,4,25)

    Holidays.on(date, :au)
    => [{:name => 'ANZAC Day',...}]

Get holidays that are observed on July 2, 2007 in British Columbia, Canada.

    date = Date.civil(2007,7,2)

    Holidays.on(date, :ca_bc, :observed)
    => [{:name => 'Canada Day',...}]

Get all holidays in July, 2008 in Canada and the US.

    from = Date.civil(2008,7,1)
    to = Date.civil(2008,7,31)

    Holidays.between(from, to, :ca, :us)
    => [{:name => 'Canada Day',...}
        {:name => 'Independence Day',...}]

Get all US Federal holidays between 2018 and 2019.

    from = Date.civil(2018,1,1)
    to = Date.civil(2019,12,31)

    Holidays.between(from, to, :federal_reserve, :observed)
    => [{:name => "New Year's Day"....}
        {:name => "Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr"....}]

Get informal holidays in February.

    from = Date.civil(2008,2,1)
    to = Date.civil(2008,2,15)

    Holidays.between(from, to, :informal)
    => [{:name => 'Valentine\'s Day',...}]

Return all available regions:

    Holidays.available_regions
    => [:ar, :at, ..., :sg] # this will be a big array

To check if there are any holidays taking place during a specified work week:

    Holidays.any_holidays_during_work_week?(Date.civil(2016, 1, 1))
    => true

To find and return the next holidays occurring from date, inclusively:

    Holidays.next_holidays(3, [:us, :informal], Date.civil(2016, 2, 23))
    => [{:name => "St. Patrick's Day",...}, {:name => "Good Friday",...}, {:name => "Easter Sunday",...}]

Will default to `Date.today` if no date is provided.

To find all holidays occuring from date to end of year, inclusively:

    Holidays.year_holidays([:ca_on], Date.civil(2016, 2, 23))
    => [{:name=>"Good Friday",...},
        {name=>"Easter Sunday",...},
        {:name=>"Victoria Day",...},
        {:name=>"Canada Day",...},
        {:name=>"Civic Holiday",...},
        {:name=>"Labour Day",...},
        {:name=>"Thanksgiving",...},
        {:name=>"Remembrance Day",...},
        {:name=>"Christmas Day",...},
        {:name=>"Boxing Day",...}]

Will default to `Date.today` if no date is provided.

### Loading Custom Definitions on the fly

Load custom definitions file on the fly and use them immediately.

Load custom 'Company Founding' holiday on June 1st:

    Holidays.load_custom('/home/user/holiday_definitions/custom_holidays.yaml')

    date = Date.civil(2013,6,1)

    Holidays.on(date, :my_custom_region)
      => [{:name => 'Company Founding',...}]

Custom definition files must match the format of the existing definition YAML files location in the 'definitions' directory.

Multiple files can also be passed:

    Holidays.load_custom('/home/user/holidays/custom_holidays1.yaml', '/home/user/holidays/custom_holidays2.yaml')

### Extending Ruby's Date and Time classes

To extend the 'Date' class:

    require 'holidays/core_extensions/date'
    class Date
      include Holidays::CoreExtensions::Date
    end

Now you can check which holidays occur in Iceland on January 1, 2008:

    d = Date.civil(2008,7,1)

    d.holidays(:is)
    => [{:name => 'Nýársdagur'}...]

Or lookup Canada Day in different regions:

    d = Date.civil(2008,7,1)

    d.holiday?(:ca) # Canada
    => true

    d.holiday?(:ca_bc) # British Columbia, Canada
    => true

    d.holiday?(:fr) # France
    => false

Or return the new date based on the options:

    d = Date.civil(2008,7,1)
    d.change(:year => 2016, :month => 1, :day => 1)
    => #<Date: 2016-01-01 ((2457389j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>

Or you can calculate the day of the month:

    Date.calculate_mday(2015, 4, :first, 2)
    => 7

Or find end of month for given date (requires 'Time' extensions as well):

    d = Date.civil(2016,8,1)
    d.end_of_month
    => #<Date: 2016-08-31 ((2457632j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>

### Caching Holiday Lookups

If you are checking holidays regularly you can cache your results for improved performance. Run this before looking up a holiday (eg. in an initializer):

    Holidays.cache_between(Time.now, 2.years.from_now, :ca, :us, :observed)

Holidays for the regions specified within the dates specified will be pre-calculated and stored in-memory. Future lookups will be much faster.
